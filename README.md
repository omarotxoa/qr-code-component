### Process
-  Having recently read about CUBE CSS and other such design systems and philosophies, I wanted to implement some of what I have learned. In particular, I wanted to use CSS Custom Properties and stay away from adding needless classes and media queries - keeping with the natural responsiveness of the browser and using elements to style as much as possible. 
- I did not include the 700 weight for the font as designated in the style-guide.md provided by Front End Mentor. I found that there was no need for it. Using an h3 for the title provided a default weight without need to specify it in code. 
- Likewise I chose to ignore the pixel specific breakpoints, opting to use the natural responsiveness of the browser instead of media queries.
- I threw in an @keyframes animation just for the fun. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
